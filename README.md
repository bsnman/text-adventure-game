# Text Adventure Game

A small text-based adventure game built with **Vue 3**, **TypeScript** and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). The repository currently contains a basic game screen and can be used as a starting point for your own adventure.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173/` by default.

3. **Build for production**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   The compiled files will be generated in the `dist` directory.

## Project Structure

```
src/
  assets/          # static assets
  components/      # Vue components
  data/            # game data (currently empty)
  types/           # TypeScript types
```

Modify files in `src/data` and `src/components` to extend the game, create new scenes or add features.
